# Author instructions

Papers can be submitted to either the *Conference track* or the *Abstract track*.

## Conference track

Full papers in the conference track contain methodological developments or well-validated applications of deep learning algorithms in medical imaging. There is no strict limit on paper length. However, we strongly recommend keeping the paper at 8 pages, plus 1 page for the references and as many pages as needed in an appendix section. The appropriateness of using additional pages over the recommended length will be judged by reviewers.

## Abstract track

Extended abstracts in the abstract track are up to 3 pages and can, for example,  focus on novel methodological ideas without extensive validation. We also specifically accept extended abstracts of recently published or submitted journal contributions to give authors the opportunity to present their work and obtain feedback from conference attendees.

## Paper preparation

Both the Conference and Abstract track papers should be prepared using the [MIDL 2018 Latex style file](/midl_2018.sty) (derived from the NIPS style files). Please use the [final] option to include author information in the PDF (`\usepackage[final]{midl_2018}`).

## Poster preparation

The poster format is A0 portrait. Poster boards are 841 mm wide x 1189 mm tall (equivalent to 33.1 inch wide x 46.8 inch tall). Adhesive material and/or pins will be provided for mounting the posters to the boards. Each poster will be assigned a poster number which will be indicated on the poster boards. Presenters are asked to install their posters during the coffee break preferably on July 4th. We strongly encourage the authors to leave the posters installed during the whole conference. Posters are to be removed from the poster boards by the presenters after the closing ceremony.

## Oral presentation preparation

Each oral presentation is allocated 20 minute slot. Presentations must not exceed 15 minutes leaving 5 minutes for questions and discussion. Please prepare your presentations in Power Point or PDF format. Note that the format of the beamer is 16:9. Authors are required to upload their presentation to the computer installed in the room prior to the oral session. We will NOT connect your personal laptop to the presentation system.

## Submitting a paper

Papers should be submitted on the [OpenReview platform](https://openreview.net/group?id=MIDL.io/2018) as a single PDF. Revisions can be submitted up until the submission deadline of April 11th 23.59 CEST.

## Reviewing process

Papers submitted to the conference track will go through a full, single-blind reviewing process via OpenReview. Program chairs will assign each paper to three program committee members who will provide high-quality reviews. In addition to the official reviews, all users of OpenReview can comment on papers. Authors can respond to comments and reviews. Program chairs will decide on final acceptance or rejection based on the submitted paper and the provided reviews; there is no official rebuttal phase. Accepted papers will be assigned to oral or poster presentation by the program chairs.

Selection of abstracts is performed via a light single-blind review process. Accepted abstracts will be presented as posters at the conference.

## Special Issue in Medical Image Analysis

The best accepted full conference papers will be invited for submission to a special issue of Medical Image Analysis, a top journal in the field. [More details are available on a separate page](/special-issue.html).
