# Keynote speakers

## Prof. Ronald Summers

### Senior Investigator and Staff Radiologist at the NIH

![Portrait of Ronald Summers](/keynotes/summers.jpg)
Ronald M. Summers received the B.A. degree in physics and the M.D. and Ph.D. degrees in Medicine/Anatomy & Cell Biology
from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1994, he joined the Diagnostic Radiology Department at the NIH Clinical Center
in Bethesda, MD where he is now a tenured Senior Investigator and Staff Radiologist. In 2013, he was named a Fellow of
the Society of Abdominal Radiologists. He is currently Chief of the Clinical Image Processing Service and directs the
Imaging Biomarkers and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) Laboratory. In 2000, he received the Presidential Early Career
Award for Scientists and Engineers, presented by Dr. Neal Lane, President Clinton’s science advisor. In 2012, he
received the NIH Director’s Award, presented by NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins. His research interests include deep
learning, virtual colonoscopy, CAD and development of large radiologic image databases. His clinical areas of specialty
are thoracic and abdominal radiology and body cross-sectional imaging. He is a member of the editorial boards of the
Journal of Medical Imaging and Academic Radiology and a past member of the editorial board of Radiology. He is a program
committee member of the Computer-aided Diagnosis section of the annual SPIE Medical Imaging conference and will be
co-chair of the entire conference in 2018 and 2019.

## Dr. Graham Taylor

### Associate Professor at University of Guelph

![Portrait of Graham Taylor](/keynotes/taylor.jpg)
Graham Taylor is an Associate Professor of Engineering at the University of Guelph, a CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholar, an
Academic Director of NextAI, and a member at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence. His research aims to
discover new algorithms and architectures for deep learning: the automatic construction of hierarchical algorithms from
high-dimensional, unstructured data. He is especially interested in time series, having applied his work to better
understand human and animal behaviour, environmental data (climate or agricultural), audio (music or speech) and medical
informatics. His work also intersects high performance computing, investigating better ways to leverage hardware
accelerators to cope with the challenges of large-scale machine learning. He co-organizes the annual CIFAR Deep Learning
Summer School, and has trained more than 50 students and staff members on AI-related projects.

Adriana Romero is a research scientist at Facebook AI Research and an adjunct professor at McGill University.
Previously, she was a post-doctoral researcher at Montreal Institute for Learning algorithms, advised by Prof.
Yoshua Bengio. Her research revolves around deep learning techniques to tackle biomedical data analysis challenges,
addressing impactful problems for society by paving the road towards enabling widespread usage of personalized medicine.
Adriana received her Ph.D. from the University of Barcelona in 2015 with a thesis on assisting the training of deep
neural networks with applications to computer vision, advised by Dr. Carlo Gatta. Her PhD included contributions in the
fields of representation learning and model compression, with applications to image classification, image segmentation
and remote sensing.

## Dr. Tim Salimans
### Research Scientist at OpenAI
### Scientific Advisor and Co-Founder at Aidence

![Portrait of Tim Salimans](/keynotes/salimans.jpg)
Tim Salimans is a Machine Learning research scientist working on generative modeling, semi-supervised and unsupervised
deep learning, and reinforcement learning. He received his PhD from Erasmus University Rotterdam. He is most well known
for his work on GANs and VAEs. He received the 2014 Lindley prize for his work in variational inference using
reparameterization and he is the winner of multiple Kaggle competitions. At MIDL he will be speaking about his work with
Aidence, the Amsterdam startup that's building a Deep Learning software platform to help radiologists improve their
diagnostic accuracy and reading efficiency.
