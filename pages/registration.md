Registration for the conference followed two stages; the first slots that were made available during the first stage have been filled. Subsequently, authors of accepted papers got the opportunity to register using the invitation link that they had received via email. On May 29th, we reopened the final 50 slots for MIDL, which filled up on the same day.

Registration is closed and we have also closed the reserve list as we are now fully booked. **We will not have on-site registration**, so please do not book any travel to Amsterdam in the hope of participating in the conference. We simply do not have the capacity to host any more attendees.

## Travel grants

We will be offering a limited number of [student travel grants](/awards.html) to students who are first authors of submitted papers. Students will be required to submit proof of their student status after registration. A short letter signed by their supervisor will suffice.

## Hotel rooms

The conference hotel is offering discounts for stays during the conference. [More information](/venue.html)
